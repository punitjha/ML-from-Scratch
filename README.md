# ML From Scratch

The purpose of this repo is to learn coding ML methods from scratch using Python Numpy only. These methods run on your laptop and not intended for applications on heavey datasets. The following methods were implemented. 

  - Adaboost On Stumps
  - Feed Forward Neural Network
  - GMM
  - HMM
  - PCA
  - RNN -
  - Stochastic Gradient Descent Variants - SGD with Momentum or Nesterov Accelerated Gradient, and Adam
